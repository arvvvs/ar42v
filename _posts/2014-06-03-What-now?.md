So I finally finished building this website blog what should I do now? Or what am I doing?

I have finished reading "Autobiography of Malcolm X", and begun reading "Surely you're joking Mr. Fenyman".  
My laptop, my poor poor laptop has busted it's charging port and needs to be fixed.  I usually have to wiggle around for a good five minutes for it to charge consistently.  So I will be going to what is known as the Silicon Valley of Beijing and finding a Computer Repair store that has the ability to do so! And will post pictures.  
I am also reading Pro-Git right now and it's so far an excellent read.  It required downloading the free to read pdf on my Dad's Kindle HDx whihc I stole.  Without guilt because he never uses it.
