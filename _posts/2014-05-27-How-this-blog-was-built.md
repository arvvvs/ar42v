First of all before I start I would like to thank Dan O'Connor for helping me out with this blog.  He pointed me to key technologies that helped make this endevor possible.  
I used the HTML5 Boilerplate Framework which provided me with an excellent base to start building this Website so I wouldn't have to spend so much time on arcane CSS.  Well not as much.  
I then integrated the Framework with the Ruby-based Jekyll to handle things like post generation.
