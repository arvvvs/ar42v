        Most of the projects I have worked on have been school related and are scattered accross different remote machines.  However I am slowly developing a porfolio outside of school projects starting with this website- which I used to learn HTML/CSS and Jekyll.

                I built this website with the HTML5 Boilerplate Framework and used Jekyll to generate different parts of the website, including the Blog, Projects and About Me pages.  A lot of debt is owed to my friend <a class="in-post-links" href="danoc.me">Dan O'Connor</a> who advised me on what framework to use, introduced me to Jekyll and gave me links to a lot of tutorials.  This was my first major project with HTML/CSS other than a few wranglings in 8th Grade and helping out a friend with a project.  If you want to go feel free to visit the <a class="in-post-links"href="github.com/arvvvs/ar42v"> Github page</a>.<br>
                This is only version 1.0 for the website.  In the future I plan on making this website more responsive so it can load on multiple devices and make it look prettier, and keep incorporating new technologies.</li>
