<p class="infoParagraph">I am a Senior at Binghamton University studying Math and CS.  Although I am a US Born Citizen (albeit with an Indian accent), I have lived abroad most of my life- from India to Japan and China.  And as I write this page, I am currently my home in Beijing China.
I like to think that I am a dynamic, humorous, fun loving person, always open to new ideas and activities.  Although I have at least in my sisters opinion, a very narrow taste in music- and I agree that I should never be the person to pick the party playlist.<br>
A few other things about me, if you aren't bored already.  I love food, and due to my expatriate life I have had the pleasure of tasting many different cuisines, with Szechuan and it's heavy spice content being my favorite.<br>
And in order to support my foodie habit(in order to keep eating more) I am an avid runner.  I have run two half marathon's in last two years. My dream is to someday qualify for the Boston Marathon, and possibly even run an Ultra Marathon.<br>
In the realm of technology I am an open source advocate.  I run the latest Ubuntu on my simple laptop which carries a lot of character(Read: I'm surprised it still functions).  I use Vim for my coding needs- although I am not completely proficient in it's functionality. 
I have been using open source technology since the eight grade when I first installed OpenOffice.org on my then and still ancient Dell Pentium 3.  I eventually moved on and installed Xubuntu 6.10 on it- and this was back when wireless drivers still required random poking to function.  I eventually persuaded my parents to let me install Ubuntu 7.04 on the family computer just so I could use Compiz's fancy rotating cube effect.  Which introduced me to the utter misery that was the Xorg.conf file.  If you are reading this and do not know what the Xorg.conf file is count yourself amongst the living.<br>
So what is the function of this blog?  It's primary purpose is to act as an avenue so I can learn more Web Development skills.  And I don't plan on leaving it barren content wise.  I plan on posting regularly on a multitude of topics including technology, code, food, books, and other musings.  And maybe if I believe myself to be proficient enough I'll post a few tutorials.<br>
Maybe more.  After all in these confines I am it's God and Creator.  </p>
